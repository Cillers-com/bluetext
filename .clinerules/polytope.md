Avoid running the services you write. Let the user run them using Polytope instead.

Do not change any files under the .context or .blueprints directories, unless the user specifically gives you the permission to do so.

Do not try to test the functionality you generate. You don't know enough about how Polytope works to be able to do that in a reliable way.
