# Polytope Documentation Reference

This file contains comprehensive documentation about Polytope, a job runner platform that uses computational graphs based on steps and modules.

## Core Concepts

### Jobs and Steps
- A **job** is a computational graph based on one or more **steps** arranged in any configuration
- Each step runs a **module** which executes code against Polytope's runner API
- Steps can spawn containers, save datasets, create services, and perform other actions

### Modules
- Modules are the core building blocks of Polytope
- Each step runs a module that interfaces with Polytope's runner API
- Polytope provides 50+ built-in modules for common use cases
- Custom modules can be defined using the same interface
- Modules typically accept parameter input conforming to specified types
- Modules can run code snippets directly or wrap other modules

### Templates
- Templates are blueprints for full jobs
- Define what steps to run for easy reuse
- Specified using TemplateSpec data type

### Configuration Files
- Modules, templates, and triggers are defined in Polytope files
- Supported formats: `polytope.yml`, `polytope.json`, or `polytope.edn`
- Files are placed in Git-versioned repositories

### Other Key Concepts
- **Containers**: Docker containers spawned by steps, with replication and autoscaling support
- **Datasets**: Versioned data that can be used as step inputs/outputs
- **Services**: Expose container ports for interaction (localhost for CLI, autogenerated URLs for web service)
- **Values**: Built-in key-value store for steps to read/write
- **Volumes**: Share data between different steps or jobs
- **Triggers**: Run jobs on schedule or following specific events
- **Projects**: Work organization unit in web service, can be owned by users or organizations

## polytope.yml file

The contents of the polytope.yml file must follow the data type PolytopeFile that is specified in the Polytope data types documentation.

## Module life cycle.
In Polytope, the container that a module is running in is stopped when the command specified by the cmd parameter has run to completion. That means that any service started by the script will also be shut down when the script completes.
